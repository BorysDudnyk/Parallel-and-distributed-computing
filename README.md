Multithreading and Asynchronous Programming Examples
This repository contains examples of asynchronous and multithreaded programming in various languages such as JavaScript, Dart, and C (using OpenMP and PThreads). These examples demonstrate different approaches to parallel and concurrent execution to improve program performance and efficiency.

1. Asynchronous Programming in JavaScript
Description: Demonstrates how to use JavaScript's Promises for asynchronous programming. It includes an example that uses a delay function to pause the execution for a specified duration before performing an action.
2. Asynchronous Programming in Dart
Description: Shows how to implement asynchronous programming in Dart using the async and await keywords. The example includes fetching data from an API and handling potential errors using try-catch blocks.
3. Parallel Programming in Dart
Description: Demonstrates parallel execution in Dart, including fetching data from an API, calculating Fibonacci numbers, and using the Future class for asynchronous operations.
4. Basic Information about the OpenMP Interface
Description: Provides an introduction to OpenMP, a C/C++ interface for parallel programming. The example shows how to set the number of threads and use parallel directives.
5. Working with OpenMP Loops
Description: Demonstrates how to use OpenMP to parallelize loop iterations and perform calculations on arrays. It also includes the use of reduction clauses to calculate the product of array elements.
6. PThreads - POSIX Standard Implementation of Threads
Description: Shows how to create and manage threads using the PThreads library in C. The example includes printing either a first name or last name based on thread ID.
7. Synchronization of PThreads Threads
Description: Demonstrates how to synchronize threads using PThreads mutexes to avoid data races. The example involves computing values in arrays and calculating a product with synchronized access.
Installation and Usage
JavaScript: Ensure you have Node.js installed. Execute the script directly using node script.js.

Dart: Install the Dart SDK if not already installed. Run Dart scripts using the dart command.

C with OpenMP: Install a C compiler that supports OpenMP, such as GCC. Compile the code using gcc -fopenmp code.c -o code and execute the compiled binary.

C with PThreads: Ensure you have a C compiler that supports POSIX threads, such as GCC. Compile the code using gcc code.c -o code -lpthread and execute the compiled binary.

Additional Notes
Experiment with modifying the provided examples to suit your specific use case and further explore parallel and asynchronous programming concepts.
Refer to official documentation for each language and library for more detailed usage instructions and advanced features.
Happy coding and exploring the world of asynchronous and multithreaded programming!
